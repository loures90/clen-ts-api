# Design Patterns:

## 1. Adapter:
Adapter are used to make invertion dependency at an internal layer to an external layer. ExpressAdpaterRouter for example adapts Controllers layer (internal) to point to Express framework (external).

## 2. Composite: 
Main layer is going to couple all the layers of the project.
