# Design Patterns:

## 1. Adapter:
Adapter are used to make invertion dependency at an internal layer to an external layer. ExpressAdpaterRouter for example adapts Controllers layer (internal) to point to Express framework (external).

## 2. Composite: 
Main layer is going to couple all the layers of the project.
In Presentation layer at validation, ValidationComposite class composes the validations of controllers: EmailValidation and RequiredFieldsValidation

## 3. Factory:
Creational Design Pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass.

## 4. Decorator:
Attach new behaviours to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contains behaviors.

# Clean Code
## Dependency Injection
Dependency Injection is technic that makes a class independent of its dependencies. It happens by decoupling the usage of an object from its creation. And helps to achieve SOLID principles of Dependency Inversion and Single Responsability.

## Dependency Inversion
High level modules should not depend on low level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should be determined by Abstractions.

## Notes:

SUT - System Under Test
STUB - System Test Double 

The main layer is the most coupled layer of the repository, it sees all others layers.
